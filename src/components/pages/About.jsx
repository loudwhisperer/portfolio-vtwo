        I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in writing , audio
        production and game designs with deep roots in customer service and a
        thirst to keep learning and developing myself. Impeccable at solving
        problems on my feet, I learn best in high volume and rarely crumble
        under stress. I am on a mission to make the most user-friendly beautiful
        applications that I can look back on as accomplishments not just work. I
        am known by any employer and team as a leader, an innovator and the most
        tenacious human they have ever met no matter the complexity of a task.
